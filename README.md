# Autism-Project
project related to detecting autism in children between ages 0 - 5


Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological disorder that results in aberrant
personality traits, cognitive function, and interpersonal relationships. It impacts the childâ€™s linguistic
and social skills, interaction abilities, and capacity for logical thought. It is possible to use the human
face as a physiological identifier since it can serve as an indicator of brain function, thus helping
with early diagnosis in a simple and effective way. The purpose of this study is to detect autism
from facial images using a deep learning model. To accurately identify autism in children, we used
three pre-trained CNN models, VGG16, VGG19 and, EfficientnetB0, as feature extractors and binary
classifiers. The suggested models were trained using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle that
included 3014 images of children characterized as autistic and non-autistic. The models yielded
accuracies of 84.66%, 80.05%, and 87.9%, respectively.
